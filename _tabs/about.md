Hello there, my name is Arnaud, i'm 25 years old and I work as a cybersecurity consultant doing mostly SecOps automation and DevSecOps.
Between work and university, i enjoy eating food (who doesn't), sports and animes. 
I'm trying to further develop my skills in red teaming, reverse engineering and maybe learn a thing or two about malware development (we'll see about that one).
I enjoy the process of documenting my work so why not document my journey learning new things from the begining? ðŸ˜Š
