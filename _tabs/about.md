Hello there, my name is Arnaud, i'm 25 years old and I work as a cybersecurity consultant doing mostly SecOps automation and DevSecOps.  
Between work and university, i enjoy eating food (who doesn't), sports and animes.   
I'm trying to further develop my skills in red teaming, reverse engineering and maybe learn a thing or two about malware development (we'll see about that one).  
I decided to create this site mostly because I enjoy the process of documenting my work and as a way to assess my progress over time.😊
